# DETECTING-ANOMALIES-AND-VISUALIZING-DATA

This project involves analyzing and preparing cybersecurity datasets to detect network anomalies using machine learning. It focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and visualization to gain insights.

Key Steps:

1. Loaded and cleaned datasets by fixing column names, handling missing and infinite values.

2. Created binary labels to distinguish attack and benign traffic.

3. Scaled numerical features for consistent input to models.

4. Trained an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies.

5. Evaluated model performance with confusion matrices and classification reports.

6. Visualized results with bar charts and correlation heatmaps to identify important features.

7. Learning Outcomes:

8. Data preprocessing and feature engineering for cybersecurity data.

9. Application of Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

10. Interpretation of model metrics and insights through visualization.
